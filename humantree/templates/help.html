<p>Our training set is based upon the Cambridge GIS (collected in 2014) and present-day (~2018) Google Maps imagery, which means that there are mismatches between regions marked as tree/not tree as individual trees have either been added or removed in the past 4 years. Additionally, the original training set itself has some malformed masks that need to be identified.</p>

<p>On this page, you can help us improve the data we train upon! Above you should see a satellite image overlaid with a magenta mask for that image marking the tree locations. We would like you to rate each mask as being either "good," "okay," or "bad."</p>

<p>There is of course some subjectivity in this assessment, but the following rubrick should give some sense of what "good," "okay," and "bad" correspond to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good: &gt;90% of image area accurately labeled as tree/not tree.
  <li>Okay: 70 - 90% of image area accurately labeled.
  <li>Bad: &lt;70% of image area accurately labeled.
</ul>

<p>Clicking one of the buttons above should reload this page and provide a new image to assess. The captcha must be solved before assessments will be accepted.</p>
