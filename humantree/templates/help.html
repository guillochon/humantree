<p>Our training set is based upon the Cambridge GIS (collected in 2014) and present-day Google Maps imagery, which means that there are mismatches between regions marked as tree/not tree as individual trees have either been added or removed. Additionally, the original training set has some masks that are inaccurate, and our outputs from the convolutional neural network are also imperfect.</p>

<p>On this page, you can help us do better! Below you should see two images, one corresponding to the current satellite imagery, and one corresponding to our mask for that region. The regions in black are supposed to correspond to the tree canopy: we would like you to help us determine if that is the case by marking each mask as either being "accurate" or "inaccurate".</p>

<p>There is of course some subjectivity in this assessment, but a good rule of thumb is that if >10% of the mask is mismatched with the image, that mask should be considered "inaccurate."</p>

<p>Making your assessment on a given image pair should reload this page. No login is required (only a captcha).</p>
