# humantree

## Installing
This package requires a few API keys to be fully functional:

- Google: Place a `google.key` file into run directory with single line containing the key.
- Zillow: `zillow.key`, same as above.
- EIA: `eia.key`, same as above.

If one wishes to run the web server, some npm packages are needed, install these in the `humantree/static` directory:
